# Blackhole Simulation

A C++ learning project using OpenGL to simulate the motion of light particles in the presence of a black hole.  
The simulation visualizes how gravity curves particle trajectories, providing an interactive way to explore relativistic physics concepts.  

- Implements real-time rendering of light particles moving toward a central black hole
- Illustrates gravitational effects on trajectories
- Serves as a C++ and OpenGL learning exercise
